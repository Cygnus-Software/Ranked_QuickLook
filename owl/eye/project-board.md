# Creating a project board

Project boards can be used to create customized workflows to suit your needs, like tracking and prioritizing specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists.

You can use a project board template to create a project board with automation already configured.

You can also copy a project board to reuse its customizations for similar projects.

You can link up to twenty-five repositories to your organization or user-owned project board. Linking repositories makes it easier to add issues and pull requests from those repositories to your project board using. Add cards or from the issue or pull requests sidebar.

Once you've created your project board, you can add issues, pull requests, and notes to it. For more information, see "Adding issues and pull requests to a project board" and "Adding notes to a project board."

You can also configure workflow automations to keep your project board in sync with the status of issues and pull requests.

You can use GitHub's API to import a project board.
